            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Chase Lake, a physicist and computer programmer located
                 in downtown Denver. I'm a freelance programmer 
                 specializing in standalone object-oriented applications in 
                 C++ and Java, web applications, and embedded system 
                 programming. I also work with video games, virtual 
                 reality, mobile application development, and networking to
                 a lesser extent.</p>

                <p>I graduated from Whitworth University in 2019 with a 
                 bachelor's degree in both Physics and Computer Science and
                 a minor in Mathematics and moved to Denver with my 
                 girlfriend for work in October of 2020. I have worked on a 
                 large variety of complex projects, using both modern 
                 physics and computer technologies to solve technical 
                 problems.</p>
                 
                <p>Some professional things I'm passionate about are 
                 scientific education, modern technologies, team 
                 organization, and project management. I believe everyone 
                 should have access to high quality education, excellent 
                 modern technology, and an effective and enjoyable team.</p>

                <p>Less professional things I'm passionate about are cooking, 
                 traveling, board games and tabletop games, hiking, 
                 snowboarding, video games, and reading among other hobbies.

                from customer service-oriented positions to technical 
                research positions. I moved to Denver in October of 2020 
                during the pandemic and have been developing my career path 
                ever since. For a more up-to-date list of my job experience,
